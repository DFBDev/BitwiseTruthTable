# BitwiseTruthTable
College project in Computer Organization. Calculates Boolean Expression results for differing, sequential parameters of 2-4 bit binary.

The main objective for this project was to take in a user-entered boolean expression, containing 2-4 undesignated variables, and solve the expression given multiple cases of differing binary values (in order of operator precedence). Below is a sample output:

Code contains no non-portable libraries/dependencies, only standard C++ library.
Program runs in terminal and was developed in Visual Studio.
